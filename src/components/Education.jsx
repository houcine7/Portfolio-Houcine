              I'm a Software Engineer <br />
              I've always been fascinated by IT and I am more interested in web
              development. I started to learn and discover as much as possible
              about this field. And now I become more familiar with a variety of
              web development processes, including UX, UI design, database
              design, and with front-end and back-end technologies. For me the
              idea of creating something that didnâ€™t previously exist ,the joy
              of building something and seeing it come to life is what makes Web
              development really amazing .And every day you get to learn
              something new.
